This case is the DSM part of
1D synthetic (three components) benchmark using the IASP91 velocity model and PREM attenuation model.

How to run this example:
0. Before run this example, make sure the corresponding SEM part has been successfully finished.

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.)

2. compile:
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/src
   > make

3. run DSM
   >cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/example/iasp91_1D_benchmark_three_components
   >./run_three_single_forces.sh

4. When DSM computations of all the three single forces are done, go to the directory
        SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/1D_iasp91_benchmark_three_components and run run_coupling.sh.
