This case is the DSM part of simulating the 2016/10/27 Mw6.0 off Southern Chile earthquake.
The 1D model is the IASP91 velocity model and PREM attenuation model.

How to run this example:
0. Before run this example, make sure the corresponding SEM part has been successfully finished.

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.) 

2. compile:
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/src
   > make

3. run DSM
   >cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/example/SouthAmerica_Earthquake_161027
   >./run_DSM.sh

4. When DSM computation is done, go to the directory
        SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/SouthAmerica_Earthquake_161027
   and run run_coupling.sh.
