This case is the last coupling step of 3D synthetics with a sinusoidal_topography.
The backgroud 1D model is the IASP91 velocity model and no attenuation.


How to run this example:
0. Before run this example, make sure the corresponding SEM and DSM parts has been 
   successfully finished.

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.)

2. compile the codes(the default compiler is 'ifort', you may need to reedit 'Makefile' to 
   use 'gfortran'). There are two options and you can use either one of them.
     Option I: linear interpolation scheme
     > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/src/Linear_piecewise_interpolation
     > make
     Option II:Lagrange interpolation scheme
     > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/src/Lagrange_interpolation
     > make 

3. run coupling
   >cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/iasp91_sinusoidal_topography_no_attnueation
   >.run_coupling.sh

4. When it is done, the hybrid synthetics in sac format are saved in the directory
   seismograms. You can compare your results with the ones stored in the directory
   seismograms_backup and they should be the same. If not, there must be something(s)
   wrong.
   Note that:
   (1) Only vertical components are valid, because we do not compute Green's function
       due to the two horizontal components.
   (2) The seismograms are displacement and the unit is 10^(-15) meters. Thus,
       you need to multiply them with 10^(-15) to get an unit of meter.
   (3) The maximum resolved frequency is the lower one between the maximum resolved
       frequencies of SEM and DSM. In this case, it is 0.125 Hz, equal to the maximum frequency
       of Green's functions from DSM.
   (4) There might be large errors at very low frequencies (i.e. <0.01 Hz), due to errors from
       series of sources, including SEM computation, local wavefield approximation and tapering
       the SEM synthetics.
