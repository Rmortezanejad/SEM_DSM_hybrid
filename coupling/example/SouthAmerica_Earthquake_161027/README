This case is the last coupling step of simulating the 2016/10/27 Mw6.0 off Southern Chile earthquake..
The 1D model is the IASP91 velocity model and PREM attenuation model.


How to run this example:
0. Before run this example, make sure the corresponding SEM and DSM parts has been 
   successfully finished.

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.)

2. compile the codes(the default compiler is 'ifort', you may need to reedit 'Makefile' to 
   use 'gfortran'). There are two options and you can use either one of them.
     Option I: linear interpolation scheme
     > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/src/Linear_piecewise_interpolation
     > make
     Option II:Lagrange interpolation scheme
     > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/src/Lagrange_interpolation
     > make 

3. run coupling
   >cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/SouthAmerica_Earthquake_161027
   >.run_coupling.sh

4. When it is done, the hybrid synthetics in sac format are saved in the directory
   seismograms. You can compare your results with the ones stored in the directory
   seismograms_backup and they should be the same. If not, there must be something(s)
   wrong.
   Note that:
   (1) Only vertical components are valid, because we do not compute Green's function
       due to the two horizontal components.
   (2) The seismograms are displacement and the unit is 10^(-15) meters. Thus,
       you need to multiply them with 10^(-15) to get an unit of meter.
   (3) The maximum resolved frequency is the lower one between the maximum resolved
       frequencies of SEM and DSM. In this case, it is 0.125 Hz, equal to the maximum frequency
       of Green's functions from DSM.
   (4) Only the direct P-waves in the first 60 seconds (or a little bit longer, e.g 120 seconds) 
       has been checked. Do not use the waves later than that. Because the ocean is truncated at 
       the boundaries of SEM box, large errors might be present in the very late waves (see the 2017 
       GJI paper by Wu et. al, especially Fig. S9).
