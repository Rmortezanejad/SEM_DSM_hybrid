# SEM-DSM-coupling-at-source-side
SEM-DSM-coupling is a hybrid method to efficiently compute teleseismic synthetics with 3D seismic strucure at source side and 1D strucure outside the source region. We couple the 3D method SPECFEM3D_Cartesian with the 1D method DSM. 
SPECFEM3D_Cartesian is developed by Dimitri Komatitssch et al. and public available from https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d/). The DSM code used here is developed by Nozomu Takeuchi and available from http://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/people/takeuchi/software/index.html.
