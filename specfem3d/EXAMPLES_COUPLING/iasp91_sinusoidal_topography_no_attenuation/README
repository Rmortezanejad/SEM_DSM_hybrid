This case is the SEM part of 3D synthetics with a sinusoidal_topography.
The backgroud 1D model is the IASP91 velocity model and no attenuation.
In this SEM step, we turn off the attenuation option. 

How to run this example:

0. Read the user manual in SEM_DSM_coupling/doc/manual_SEM_DSM_coupling.pdf

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.)

2. in SPECFEM3d root directory, configure, e.g.,
   > ./configure FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90
   'ifort' is prefered. However, you may want to use 
   'FC=gfortran' when 'ifort' is not available

3. compile:
   > make all

4. compile the codes for converting topography in (lon,lat) cooridinates to that 
   in a cubed-sphere (xi,eta) coordinates
   Depending on your system's setups, you may need to reedit the 'Makefile'
   , replace the 'ifort' by 'gfortran' and then compile the codes.
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/specfem3d/src/cubedsphere_topo
   > make
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/specfem3d/src/cubedsphere_topo_ReDefineOceanBot
   > make


5. run mesher and solver:
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/specfem3d/EXAMPLES_COUPLING/iasp91_sinusoidal_topography_no_attenuation
   > ./run_SEM.sh

6. Make sure that the SEM running here is successfuly executed. Then
   A. Go to the directory SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/example/iasp91_sinusoidal_topography_no_attnueation 
      and run_DSM.sh.
   B. When DSM computation is completed, go to the directory
      SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/iasp91_sinusoidal_topography_no_attnueation 
      and run run_coupling.sh.
