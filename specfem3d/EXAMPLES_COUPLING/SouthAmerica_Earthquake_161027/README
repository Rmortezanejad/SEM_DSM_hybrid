In this case, we incorporate real topography/batheymetry to simulate 3D wavefileds 
for the 2016/10/27 Mw6.0 off Southern Chile earthquake. 
The backgroud 1D model is the IASP91 velocity model and PREM attenuation model.
See more details in the 2017 GJI paper by Wu et. al.


How to run this example:

0. Read the user manual in SEM_DSM_coupling/doc/manual_SEM_DSM_coupling.pdf

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.)

2. in SPECFEM3d root directory, configure, e.g.,
   > ./configure FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90
   'ifort' is prefered. However, you may want to use
   'FC=gfortran' when 'ifort' is not available

3. compile:
   > make all

4. compile the codes for converting topography in (lon,lat) cooridinates to that
   in a cubed-sphere (xi,eta) coordinates
   Depending on your system's setups, you may need to reedit the 'Makefile'
   , replace the 'ifort' by 'gfortran' and then compile the codes.
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/specfem3d/src/cubedsphere_topo
   > make
   > cd SEM_DSM_hybrid/specfem3d/src/cubedsphere_topo_ReDefineOceanBot
   > make

5. run mesher and solver:
   > cd specfem3d/EXAMPLES_COUPLING/SouthAmerica_Earthquake_161027
   > ./run_SEM.sh

6. Make sure that the SEM running here is successfuly executed. Then 
   A. Go to the directory SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/example/SouthAmerica_Earthquake_161027 and run run_DSM.sh.
   B. When DSM computation is completed, go to the directory 
      SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/SouthAmerica_Earthquake_161027 and run run_coupling.sh.
