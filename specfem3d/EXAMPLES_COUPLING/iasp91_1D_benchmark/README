This case is the SEM part of
1D synthetic benchmark using the IASP91 velocity model and PREM attenuation model.


How to run this example:

0. Read the user manual in SEM_DSM_coupling/doc/manual_SEM_DSM_coupling.pdf

1. Load all the needed modules (e.g. openmpi, intel et al.)

2. in SPECFEM3d root directory, configure, e.g.,
   > ./configure FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90
   'ifort' is prefered. However, you may want to use
   'FC=gfortran' when 'ifort' is not available

3. compile:
   > make all

4. run mesher and solver:
   > cd specfem3d/EXAMPLES_COUPLING/1D_iasp91_benchmark
   > ./run_SEM.sh

5. Make sure that the SEM running here is successfuly executed. Then
     A. Go to the directory SEM_DSM_hybrid/DSM/example/1D_iasp91_benchmark and run_DSM.sh.
     B. When DSM computation is completed, go to the directory
        SEM_DSM_hybrid/coupling/example/1D_iasp91_benchmark and run_coupling.sh.
